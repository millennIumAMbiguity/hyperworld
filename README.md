# Hyperworld

This program is a work in progress, and a lot of design decisions are up in the
air. The code lacks a lot of needed documentation, so please contact me (possibly by
creating an issue) if you would like help working with this source code.

Instructions on how to build this project can be found in the win-x64-static directory.
